# Final GA Project 
# GA VR Classroom

For my final project of my Web Development course I chose to do something in VR.
VR is a fascinating area that I feel very passionate about and since this was our last project before graduating I wanted to make something that I can look back at and remember my time at General Assembly.
(we did not cover any VR during the course)

This project was very rushed because of unforeseen circumstances and I had a very short amout of time to work on it. I spent a couple of days on testing and figuring out how things work and I spent 1 day to actually build it from scratch. I'm working on a second, more improved version.
