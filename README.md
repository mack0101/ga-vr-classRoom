# Final GA Project 
# GA VR Classroom

For my final project of my Web Development course I chose to do something in VR.
VR is a fascinating area that I feel very passionate about. 
Since this was our last project before graduating I wanted to make something that I can look back at and remember my time at General Assembly.
(we did not cover any VR during the course)

This project was very rushed because of unforeseen circumstances and I'm working on a second, more improved version.
